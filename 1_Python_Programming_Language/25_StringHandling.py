String Handling:
1) Python does not have character datatype as in Python character is also considered as string of length one.

2) Like array C in C++, Python handles characters of string using square bracket and subscript i.e. index no i.e. position.

3) Position of first character in string is always zero.

4) We can extract characters from string if their position is known.


String Operators:
Sr.No.      Operators       Purpose
1           +               concatenation
2           *               repeats
3           []              slice
4           [:]             range slice
5           in              membership
6           not in          inverse of in
7           r               suppresses escape sequence
8           %               string formatting
% symbol in string formatting is the prefix to another character that defines the type of value to be inserted.
