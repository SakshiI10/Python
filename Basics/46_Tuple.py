Tuple:
1) Tuple is a collection of objects seperated by commas and enclosed using ().

2) Tuple is one of the 4 built in data types in Python.

3) Tuples are heterogenous sequence of elements.

4) Tuples are immutable (unchangeable).

5) Tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists which are mutable.

6) It occupies less memory compare to list.

7) Allows duplicates, since tuples are indexed, they can have with the same value.

8) We can create tuple by writing elements seperated by commas inside parentheses.
Tup=(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);
