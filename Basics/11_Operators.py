Operators:
1) Operations are performed using operators on variables and values.
2) Python divides operators in following groups:
    i) Arithmatic Operators
    ii) Assignment Operators
    iii) Comparison Operators
    iv) Logical Operators
    v) Identity Operators
    vi) Membership Operators
    vii) Bitwise Operators

i) Arithmatic Operators:
Operator    Name                Exampple (a=11, b=3)
+           Addition            a+b=14
-           Subtraction         a-b=8
*           Multiplication      a*b=33
/           Division            a/b=3.666666666
%           Modulus             ab=2
**          Exponentiation      a**b=1331
//          Floor division      a//b=3

ii) Assignment Operators
Operator    Name                            Example (a=15, b=4)
=           Assign                          a=15, b=4
+=          Add and Assign                  a+=b i.e., a=19
-=          Subtract and Assign             a-=b i.e., a=11
*=          Multiply and Assign             a*=b i.e., a=60
/=          Divide and Assign               a/=b i.e., a=3.75
5=          Modulus and Assign              a%=b i.e., a=3
//=         Floor division and assign       a//=b i.e., a=3
**=         Exponentiation and assign       a**=b i.e., a=50625
&=          Bitwise AND and assign          a&=b i.e., a=4
|=          Bitwise OR and assing           a|=b i.e., a=15
^=          Bitwise XOR and assign          a^=b i.e., a=11
>>=         Right shift and assign          a>>=b i.e., a=0
<<==        Left shift and assign           a<<=b i.e., a=240

iii) Comparison Operator
Operator    Name                            Example
==          Equal                           a==b ==> False
!=          Not Equal                       a!=b ==> True
>           Greater than                    a>b ==> False
<           Less than                       a<b ==> True
>=          Greater than or equal to        a<=b ==> False
<=          Less than or equal to           a<=b ==> True

iv) Logical Operator
Operator    Name                            Example (a=4, b=11)
and         Logical conjunction             a<5 and b<5 => False 
or          Logical disjunstion             a<5 and b<5 => True
not         Logical negation                not a<5 => False

v) Identity Operators
Operator    Name
is          Logical
is not      Not Logical

vi) Membership Operators
Operator    Name
in          Member
not in      Not member

vii) Bitwise Operator
Operator    Name
&           AND
|           OR
^           XOR
~           NOT
<<          Left Shift zero fill
>>          Right shift zero fill
