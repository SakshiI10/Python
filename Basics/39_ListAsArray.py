''' 
List as an Array:
1) Although Python provides Array, but we can represent list as an Array.

2) In array, Horizontal Entries are rows and Vertical entries are column.

3) 2-D Array is represented using nested list i.e. List within List, where each element is treated as row of matrix.

print(len(x))
print(len(x[0]))
print(x[0][1])
