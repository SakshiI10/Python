Introduction to Python:
1. Python is an interpreted, high level, general purpose, object oriented, versatile and very popular open source programming   language.

2. It is designed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991.

3. It is named after Monty Python.

4. Python can be used for any purpose like web development(server side), system scripting, scientific application, software development, etc.

5. Python is ideally designed for rapid prototyping of complex applications and is widely used in advanced fields of computing like Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Generation, Neural Networks, etc.

6. It is also used in connecting database system.

7. It can work on different platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pie, etc.

8. It can be treated as a functional way or procedural way or an object oriented way.

9. A development Environment called IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) has been bundled with the default implementation of the language.

10. Features of Python:
    i) Variety of Basic Data Types.
    ii) Supports OOP
    iii) Has Modules and Packages
    iv) Supports Exceptional Handling
    v) Has strong and dynamically typed datatype
    vi) Contains advanced programming features like generators and list comprehensions.
    vii) Supports Automatic Memory Management.
    
11. Python uses Interpreter (It converts high level code into machine language line by line).

12. Interpreter works as: Source Code -->  Interpreter  -->  Output

13. Interpreter can be used in 2 ways:
    i) Interactive mode
    ii) Script mode
    
14. Python Source file are treated as encoded in UTF-8.
