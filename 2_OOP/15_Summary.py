# Final Summary:
# Data Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a class to ensure they work together.

# Data Hiding: Restricting direct access to data using private attributes (e.g., __ in Python).

# Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features, often by using encapsulation and data hiding together.
