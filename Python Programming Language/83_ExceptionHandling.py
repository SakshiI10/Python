Exception:
An unwanted and unexpected event that disturbs the normal flow of a program is called an exception.

The main objective of exception handling is graceful termination of the program.

Types of Exceptions:
1. ZeroDivisionError:
It is a built-in python exception when a number is divided by 0.

2. TypeError
If you attempt to divide an integer with a string, the data types of the integer and the string object will not be compatible.
