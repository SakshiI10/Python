''' 
Python Statements are broadly divided into 2 categories
1) Simple Statement
i) Expression

ii) Assignment

iii) assert: This asserts or states the fact confidentially in the program, these are boolean expressions that are evaluated as True or False.

iv) pass: It is used when it is syntactically required to show 'do nothing'.

v) del: It is used to delete variable, user defined objects, lists, items within list, dictionaries, etc.

vi) return: It is usedto return control and/or value to calling function.

vii) yeild: Yeild can be used instead of return. The difference is that, return statement terminates a function entirely whereas yield pauses the function savng all its states and later continues from there on successive function call.

viii) raise

ix) break: It is used only in for or while loop, it terminates the loop and transfers control out of the loop.

x) continue: It is used in for or while loop, it continues the execution with the next cycle of the nearest closing loop,

xi) import: It is used to import the module and access the definitions inside imported module. It has 2 clauses, as and from. as: the name following as is bound directly to the imported module and from: is used to import specific attributers and functions only.

xii) global: This is a declaration statement which holds the value for the entire current code block.

xiii) future: This is declarative to the compiler to compile particular module using syntax that will be available in specified future release of Python.

xiii) non local: It is the category of variables that are used in nested function whose local scope is not defined.


2) Compound Statement
i) if: It evaluates given test conditions.

ii) while: This is an iterative statement where a block of code executes repeatedly as along as the test condition is true.

iii) for: It allows to perform some action for each item in a list.

# DIfference between for and while loop is that, for loop iterates over a sequence whereas while loop iterates against a predefined condition.
